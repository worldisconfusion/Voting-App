## DVote - Voting System
Our decentralized voting system leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure and transparent elections. Users connect their MetaMask wallets to participate in the voting process. After selecting their preferred candidate, users confirm their vote by transferring test Ether(Volta Token), adding a layer of security and authenticity. This transaction ensures that each vote is unique and tamper-proof. Once the transfer is confirmed, the vote is securely recorded and updated on the blockchain, guaranteeing a transparent voting process.
